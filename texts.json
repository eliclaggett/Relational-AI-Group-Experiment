      "If CMU actually had a stronger culture of collaboration, would it still be ranked as highly as it is or would a nicer, more supportive CMU just quietly slide down the rankings every year? Is competition what makes this place elite... or what holds it back?",
      "Do you think you'd be a fundamentally different person if you were doing your PhD in New York, San Francisco, or Berlin instead of Pittsburgh? Is the city shaping us more than we realize... or are we all just temporarily occupying space here until we leave for somewhere cooler?",
      "Imagine a parallel universe where every CMU PhD student went to therapy before starting their PhD. What would this university's entire social ecosystem look like?
